          We understand the importance of compliance with local building codes and safety regulations. Our team works

          <p>
            Emergency exit doors are a critical component of any building's life safety system. They provide a means of
            escape during emergencies and help contain fire and smoke to limit property damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our doors are designed to remain operational during fire conditions, with self-closing mechanisms and
            intumescent seals that expand when exposed to heat, sealing gaps around the door to prevent the spread of
            smoke and flames.
